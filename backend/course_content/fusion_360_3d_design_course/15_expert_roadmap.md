## Advanced Concepts

### Parametric Optimization
Beyond basic parameters, experts use **design automation** to create adaptive models. Consider a parametric shelf bracket:
```python
# Fusion 360 API script (Python) to auto-adjust support ribs
import adsk.core, adsk.fusion

def update_ribs(thickness: float, load: float):
    app = adsk.core.Application.get()
    design = app.activeProduct
    # Logic to calculate rib count based on load
    rib_count = int(load * 0.4) + 2  
    # Update feature parameters
    ribs = design.features.item('RibPattern')
    ribs.quantity = rib_count
    ribs.thickness = thickness * 1.5
```
*Key workflow*: Dynamically adjust components based on engineering requirements.

### Topology Optimization
Use **Generative Design** to create lightweight structures:
1. Define preserve geometries (mounting points)
2. Set obstacles (no-go zones)
3. Input load cases (forces/torques)
4. Run simulation to generate organic shapes  

### Advanced Surfacing
Master **Class-A surfaces** for automotive/consumer products:
- **Continuity Matching**: G2 (curvature) vs. G3 (acceleration) continuity
- **Patch Networks**: Creating quilted surfaces from boundary curves
- **Surface Analysis**: Zebra stripe/curvature comb diagnostics
