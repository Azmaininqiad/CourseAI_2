# Module 13: Advanced Modeling Techniques in Fusion 360

## Introduction  
Welcome to Module 13! As an intermediate Fusion 360 designer, you're ready to tackle **complex geometries, parametric workflows, and advanced surfacing**. This module focuses on three critical skills: **adaptive toolpaths, complex parametric relationships, and surface continuity control**. Mastering these will elevate your designs from basic prototypes to manufacturable, high-precision models. By the end, you'll efficiently solve real-world design challenges like organic shapes and engineering constraints.

## Topic 13.1: Adaptive Toolpaths for Complex Geometries  
### Why Adaptive Machining Matters  
Adaptive toolpaths use **algorithmic clearing strategies** to maintain constant tool engagement, reducing breakage and improving finish quality. Ideal for pockets, organic shapes, and hardened materials.  

### Key Workflow Steps  
1. **Setup & Stock Definition**  
   Define stock geometry using "Stock from Body" with 2mm offset.  
   ```markdown
   [IMAGES]: Setup panel showing stock boundaries
   ```

2. **Tool Selection**  
   Use **3D Adaptive Clearing** with these parameters:  
   - Tool: 6mm Flat End Mill (Carbide)  
   - Stepover: 30% of tool diameter  
   - Optimal Load: 1mm radial depth

   ```

3. **Avoidance Zones**  
   Create "Model Regions" to protect critical features:  
   ```python
   # Example of boundary constraint in POST
   defineBoundary("Protect_Flange", type=Preserve, offset=3.0)
   ```

**Real-World Case**: Watch bezel machining for a smartwatch housing – notice reduced tool deflection on curved walls.

## Topic 13.2: Parametric Relationships with User Parameters  
### Beyond Basic Variables  
Create dynamic designs using **formulas, conditional statements, and cross-parameter references**.  

### Practical Implementation  
1. **Global Variables Setup**  
   ```markdown
   [IMAGES]: Parameters table with formulas
   ```
   | Name       | Formula          | Description          |
   |------------|------------------|----------------------|
   | GearRatio  | 4.2              | Drive ratio          |
   | ToothCount | floor(30 * GearRatio) | Dynamic tooth calc  |

2. **Conditional Design Logic**  
   Automate hole patterns based on load thresholds:  
   ```python
   if loadForce > 500N:
       holePattern = "Hexagonal"
       holeDiameter = 8mm
   else: 
       holePattern = "Circular"
   ```

**Exercise**: Build a tension spring where coil spacing adjusts automatically when wire diameter changes.

## Topic 13.3: Mastering Surface Continuity  
### G0 to G2 Continuity Explained  
- **G0 (Contact)**: Edges meet but may have sharp transitions  
- **G1 (Tangent)**: Smooth transition with matching tangency  
- **G2 (Curvature)**: Natural curvature flow (e.g., automotive bodies)  

### Fixing Discontinuities  
1. **Patch Workspace Flow**  
   Use **Sculpt** > **Patch** to rebuild problem areas.  
   ```markdown
   [VIDEOS]: Repairing a G1 discontinuity in a drone canopy
   ```

2. **Continuity Checker**  
   Enable Analysis > Surface Continuity and target **95%+ G2 compliance** for Class-A surfaces.  

**Design Challenge**: Model a headphone earcup with <0.1mm curvature variance – use **Boundary Fill** with curvature continuity constraints.

---

## Key Takeaways  
1. Adaptive toolpaths prevent tool breakage in complex pockets  
2. Parametric formulas enable intelligent "what-if" scenarios  
3. G2 continuity is critical for high-stress or aesthetic surfaces  

---

## Practice Exercises  
1. **Machining Challenge**:  
   Machine an aluminum mold core with undercuts using adaptive toolpaths. Measure cycle time savings vs. traditional clearing.  

2. **Parametric Puzzle**:  
   Design a telescoping arm where segment lengths auto-adjust when total length changes. Use 3+ conditional statements.  

3. **Surface Refinement**:  
   Import this [test model](link_to_file) and achieve G2 continuity on all blended surfaces. Submit continuity analysis report.
