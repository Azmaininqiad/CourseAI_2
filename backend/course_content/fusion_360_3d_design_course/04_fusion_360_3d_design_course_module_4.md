# Module 4: Core 3D Modeling Techniques in Fusion 360

## Introduction  
Welcome to Module 4! This module focuses on foundational 3D modeling techniques. You'll learn how to transform 2D sketches into 3D objects, modify geometries, and combine shapes. By the end, you'll create complex models using extrusion, revolution, and boolean operationsâ€”essential skills for product design and prototyping.

## Topic 4.1: Creating 3D Objects from Sketches

### Extrusion Techniques  
**Extrusion** converts 2D sketches into 3D by "pulling" them along an axis.  
- **Parameters to control**:  
  ```markdown
  1. Distance: Depth of extrusion (e.g., 20mm)  
  2. Direction: One-sided or symmetric  
  3. Taper angle: Add draft angles (e.g., 5Â° for mold-friendly designs)  
  ```  

**Practical Example**: Creating a simple bracket  
1. Sketch a rectangle (50mm Ã— 30mm)  
2. Use **Extrude (Shortcut: E)**  
3. Set distance = 15mm, direction = symmetric  

> **Pro Tip**: Use "New Body" for separate parts and "Join" to merge with existing geometry.  

### Revolve Command  
**Revolving** spins a sketch around an axis (e.g., creating cylinders or vases).  
```markdown
Critical settings:  
- Axis: Select sketch line or construction line  
- Angle: Full 360Â° or partial (e.g., 90Â° for brackets)  
```  

**Step-by-Step Guide**: Designing a mug  
1. Sketch a mug profile with centerline axis  
2. Select **Revolve (Shortcut: R)**  
3. Set angle = 360Â°

## Topic 4.2: Advanced Modifications

### Fillets and Chamfers  
**Fillets** (rounded edges) and **Chamfers** (angled cuts) reduce stress concentrations.  

| Feature      | Use Case                          | Parameters          |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Fillet       | Smoothing sharp edges             | Radius (e.g., 3mm)  |
| Chamfer      | Beveling corners for assembly     | Distance/Angle      |  

**Workflow**:  
1. Select edges  
2. Apply **Fillet** or **Chamfer**  
3. Adjust values in dialog box  

### Hole Tool  
Create precise holes for screws, pins, or airflow:  
```markdown
- Types: Simple, Counterbore, Countersink  
- Key settings: Diameter, depth, thread specifications  
```  

**Example**: Adding M6 threaded holes  
1. Select face â†’ **Hole Tool (Shortcut: H)**  
2. Choose "Threaded" â†’ ISO Metric M6  
3. Set depth = 12mm

## Topic 4.3: Combining Geometry with Boolean Operations

### Boolean Workflows  
Combine, cut, or intersect bodies using:  
- **Union**: Merge multiple bodies  
- **Cut**: Subtract one body from another  
- **Intersect**: Keep overlapping areas  

**Tutorial**: Creating a gear-shaped knob  
1. Create cylinder (Body A) and gear sketch extrusion (Body B)  
2. Select **Modify â†’ Combine**  
3. Operation = "Cut" â†’ Target = Body A, Tool = Body B  

### Pattern Tools  
**Rectangular** and **Circular Patterns** duplicate features efficiently:  
```markdown
- Circular Pattern: Rotate copies around an axis (e.g., bolt holes)  
- Rectangular Pattern: Linear copies in rows/columns  
```  

**Exercise**: Duplicate cooling fins on a heatsink  
1. Create one fin â†’ **Create Pattern**  
2. Type = Circular, axis = heatsink center  
3. Quantity = 8, angle = 45Â°

## Key Takeaways  
1. Extrusion/Revolve form the basis of 3D modeling  
2. Fillets/chamfers improve functionality and aesthetics  
3. Booleans enable complex shape combinations  
4. Patterns optimize repetitive feature creation

## Practice Exercises  
1. **Beginner**: Create a 3D dice:  
   - Sketch a square â†’ extrude â†’ add numbered indents using "Cut" extrusion  
2. **Intermediate**: Model a fountain pen cap:  
   - Revolve the profile â†’ add clip (extrude + fillet) â†’ thread the inner cap  
3. **Challenge**: Build a multi-part assembly (e.g., simple pulley system) using joints (preview of Module 5!)
